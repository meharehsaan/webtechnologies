This repo contains all Java codes of
        => Java GUI
        => Basic OOP concepts
        => ArrayList
        => Exception Handling
        => Database Connectivity
        => Survlet CRUD application

#-----------------------------------Lab01-------------------------@cmd arugments

Write a program that takes input using command line arguments and calculates the area of a geometric shape based
on the input. The program should display the calculated area using the GUI component.

#-----------------------------------Lab02-------------------------@polymorphism

Implement the TwoDimensionalShape hierarchy
Each TwoDimensionalShape should contain method getArea to calculate the area of the two-dimensional shape.
Write a Driver class that uses an array of TwoDimensionalShape references to objects of each concrete class in the
hierarchy. The program should print a text description of the object to which each array element refers. Also, in the loop that
processes all the shapes in the array, determine whether each shape is a Circle, Square or Triangle. Make a call to area,
polymarphically.

#-----------------------------------Lab03-------------------------@Arraylist and Exception Handling

You are required to write a program for banking applications to store customer records. The program should have the
following classes:
    Write a Customer class with the following attributes:
        => name - a string representing the name of the customer.

        => age - an integer value indicating the age of the customer.
        => balance - a double value indicating the amount saved by the customer.
Provide a parameterized constructor function to initialize the instance variables.

#-----------------------------------Lab04-------------------------@File and Exception Handling

        => to write all the objects from collection to a txt file.
        => to remove an object from collection based on id.

#-----------------------------------Lab05-------------------------@JDBC

You need to build an address book that shall be capable of storing user name, address, city and phone number of

        => Mysql connector 8.0.33 is used
        => Tomcat Server 10.1.10 is used
        => I have also added database in this lab
        
#-----------------------------------Lab09-------------------------@Survlet and JDB

Remove **Arraylist** in **personInfo class** to make code work properly according to input output because of ArrayList same record show **multiple** entries.
Add your MySQL connector jar file in lib folder and compile the code.
Remove **cj** from **cm.mysql.cj.jdbc.driver** because it is used in **linux** if you are not using linux.
Add your **MySQL** server password in the connection function

<br>

You can make a Pull Request if you remove **ArrayList** from code and code is working properly with perfect **output**.
